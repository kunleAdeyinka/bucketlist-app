This is a simple bucket list application where users can register, sign in and create their bucket list. 
We'll be using Flask, a Python web application framework, to create the application, with PostgresSQL as the back end.
This is hosted on Heroku with Travis CI used for continous integration.

# Tasks
1. When the application loads up, first page should be a the welcome page asking users to sign up.
2. The user can follow links to sign up and log into the application.
3. A user should be able to sign in and logout of the application.
