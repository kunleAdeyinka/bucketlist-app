This is a simple bucket list application where users can register, sign in and create their bucket list. 
We'll be using Flask, a Python web application framework, to create the application, with PostgresSQL as the back end.
This is hosted on Heroku via this url : https://mustdolistapp.herokuapp.com/
Travis CI is used for continous integration.
