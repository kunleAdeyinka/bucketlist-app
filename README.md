# BucketList Application

**https://mustdolistapp.herokuapp.com**


[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kunleAdeyinka/bucketlist-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kunleAdeyinka/bucketlist-app)

This is a simple bucket list application where users can register, sign in and create their bucket list. 
We'll be using Flask, a Python web application framework, to create the application, with PostgresSQL as the back end.
This is hosted on Heroku with Travis CI used for continous integration.
